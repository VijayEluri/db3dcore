DB4GeO/DB3D Core API README
---------------------------

Welcome stranger to the DB4GeO/DB3D Core API!

The DB3D Core API is a completely in Java written library of
3D geometric data types (and its methods) and it even
provides the possibility to build topologically defined nets
(for example triangle nets).

A predecessor of the API called GeoToolKit has been developed
at the Collaborative Research Centre 350 at Bonn University.
The DB4GeO Core API is now maintained by members of the
Geodatabases Working Group of Prof. Breunig at the University
of Osnabrück. 

The DB4GeO Core API can be used in several kinds of geometric
computation settings such as in geoscientific information
systems.

The licence and terms of use can be found in the LICENCE.txt
file in the root folder of this Eclipse project.

A basic documentation (basic functionality overview) and
information on where to find more documentation is spotted
in the README.txt in the "docs" folder of this project.

We hope you will enjoy this piece of code. If you have any
suggestions or a bug report then have a look at the project
website for more information on this.

Enjoy yourself and: Don't Panic! :)



CREDITS
-------
The concrete concept and implementation of the DB3D Core API
has mainly been developed by Martin Breunig, Andreas Thomsen
and Wolfgang Bär, with the irreplaceable help of many others.
